	2DF5C5E7	I don't know if you've heard, but I recently lost my brother, Derrick. It was a horrible family tragedy. I can't help but think that I might have ended up with a similar fate to his if I had chosen a different path. This world is made up of people, like me, who stand tall and walk a straight line, and people, like my brother, who choose the path of wrongdoing.
