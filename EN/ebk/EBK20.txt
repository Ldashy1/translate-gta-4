	9F6542F5	Thanks Brucie. You're the man I look up to most in this world. Your boy, Niko.
	84DFA5C9	Hey man, I've got more important shit to worry about than what song is playing on the radio. Thanks anyway.
	A69BB336	I'm starting to totally FLIP MY SHIT with <a href="www.our-own-reality.com">www.our-own-reality.com</a>. I put sex tapes on the internet every day and they're running stories on Tyrone 'The Tower' Hancock??? Some old drunk who once had his name on a pair of sneakers in the 1980s. Big fucking deal. Last week I boned an air hostess, a lap dancer and a chick who once played a burn victim on Medicate Me.
	CFBD8579	You seen this ZiT! shit yet? You dial 948 555 0100 on your phone and it tells you whatever track is playing in the background. I guess there's a room full of geeks in some warehouse listening to all the songs or something. Who gives a shit how it's done, it's awesome for impressing the bitches in the clubs with your music knowledge. Not that my cut abs, bulging pecs and monster sized bar tabs don't impress them enough. You get me!?!?!?! ALPHA! Thought a player like you would appreciate this stuff.
	C8FB07A1	There are more important things in life than being a celebrity or having good abs. You've been spending too much time fluffing the bouncer at Masionette 9. - Niko
	734BCC97	Love you all. The big cheese. PS - mom - sorry, I won't be able to make Aunt Judith's tomorrow. Did you do my washing? PPS all of you bitches check out my website! It's pure bling.
	72A60156	Hey man, that could be useful. I'll try it on your radio ad and see if it can tell that a steroid pumped fantasist is talking.
	73CDBDE1	Laters,
	8106680C	I just wanted to say, I broke my own sit up record today. 2000. Genetically different, baby. You know what I'm saying? I love you all. I'm so fucking pumped I want to rip someone's throat out. If anyone wants to go out on the prowl tonight for proper weapon's grade talent and put in some serious damage with the bitches, let me know.
	7D1FD085	Later bro,
	F6ACE304	Shit, Bruice. I'll check it out. You may not be as famous as these people but you're just as much of an idiot.
	F3424C82	Have you seen the latest on <a href="www.our-own-reality.com">www.our-own-reality.com</a> ? What's that all about? Where are my peck shots, bro? How can you have celebrity news without Brucie? How many times a day do I have to email them my back catalogue of workout photos? I'm rolling at the top of my game and they're writing shit about Mr 2.0 Tony McFucking Tony! More like Mr 2ft tall Tiny McTiny. Teenage girls aren't interested in a midget with abs like cottage cheese. I'd like to see him try to benchpress 400lb with his pelvis. Nobody's more VIP than me - I've fucked more models than bulimia, baby! The paparazzi are losing their edge. We need to get out to the clubs and put some bitches to the sword! LET'S OWN IT!!!!
	FB2F68E5	I'll look at this website, man. Do you think they can get a restraining order against you for cyber stalking?
	FF195011	Nicky Boy!
	FC3ACA48	Nicky,
	E3239826	Man,
	D4DEA107	You need serious help.
	E792C1AC	Sounds like you're spending less time in the clubs and more time sitting in front of your computer and injecting Bull Shark piss. Get some perspective, man.
	F193DA71	What are you talking about?
	F16DB4BA	NB
	19DC8A14	Later,
	18E197C0	Found this website called <a href="www.vipluxuryringtones.com">www.vipluxuryringtones.com</a> You can drop some major dollars on ringtones and themes and shit. Bro, whenever you bring out your cell, bitches are gonna know how fucking money you are. Shit, when they scope my lats and then hear my VIP 100 dollar ringtone they know that Brucie is ALPHA. A high roller like you should check that shit out.
	21A78A66	Thanks Brucie
	26AB3353	What can I say? I miss that fat bastard. He was like family to me. And he was family to you. Man. I miss that guy. I haven't cried since I was two years old. Until now. On his wedding day. Man, get yourself down a gym, go out for a run, do anything to take your mind off it. I'm here for you,
	2628937C	I miss him, too.
	0467DF17	Later,
	01FEE9FB	That's MY own reality, bro. Tantric as fuck!!! Ask any doorman in Liberty City - I'm A-gaming it 24/7. My name's laminated onto the guest list at Maisonette 9 for fuck sake! I'm the kind of guy who can cage fight in the morning and get a pedicure in the afternoon. I'm metromacho, baby!!! 100% VIP with 0% BMI. But they won't put a perfect body in the media these days because it sends out the 'wrong message' to emo teenagers. It's fucked up, man. The world's gone crazy. Dial it in. Chisel it out. Genetically different.
	0B00E7D4	Man,
	180481E7	NB
	0D106BFF	Man,
	4868E72C	Later,
	463BDE55	Nicky Boy!
	4A4498B5	Yes, we are something else. I'm a slavic gun for hire and you're a steriod pumped gear head.
	619A197A	Later,
	4A45FA88	We hit that shit up - it was crazy to roll with you, homie. That racing was out of this world. I cannot wait for you to get down the gym and get some proper guns and get yourself a bloody tan. Man, you're a winner, but you do NOT look the part, amigo. Anyway, that racing was pretty intense, and I felt proud to roll with you. We're something else, man.
	2BEE2E37	Later,
	2733EF3B	I think I can live without a hundred dollar ringtone. Thanks, Brucie.
	35648B9C	I'll check out the site. Thanks, Brucie.
	3C7D5EF7	We're winners. I gotta go - I'm going to have a three way with some twins. Chicks, I mean. Not dudes. Not my vibe. I pound women, and punch men. Not the other way around.
	369C4393	Later,
