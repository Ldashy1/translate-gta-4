	A50DA45C	42
	AFCBB119	HumpPleaseRupert
	AD38CDB4	I do not like to be lied to. I try to treat people honestly and expect the same in return.
	A114F97C	Gay
	9F5FC094	I like creating my art, reading and playing guitar - not to 'perform', just like, for me. I like foreign films and graphic novels and stuff but I don't want to be labeled as a 'geek' just because I can use my brain and don't have to drink beer and shout about sports and act like a tool.
	A5029B87	FrenchTom
	A2BB55B2	I like to look good and I like it when I'm told I do. If you're going to spend time getting your look right then you should encourage people to tell you that. LOVE ME.
	90A12317	Ironing, particularly the little-known sport, Extreme Ironing - 'Get the creases out, or get out'- we iron under extreme circumstances, such as up a mountain or in a blizzard. If you're impressed, you should be. I also enjoy bee keeping (or, 'apiculture), people might laugh at me, but chicks dig the mask and the great big gloves.
	71551AF2	Northern aggression (I'm kidding, we can all be pals now!)
	6F47EEC8	I am a vulnerable guy who needs to be held by big strong arms. I am a man in need of looking after, I want to be told that I am the only guy in the world. I've got a shit load of cash and I want to spend it on the first guy I meet. Hey man, I've got so much lettuce I could open a salad bar. It's all you can eat when you're rolling with me. That's how I roll.
	7975AA4A	Yes please! Woooo!
	718A5445	People say the net ain't gangsta. I say pimpin' online still be pimpin'
	6B87F94D	People who think it's wrong to paint tiny swastikas on the pelts of bees. But is it so wrong? Is it? Is it wrong to tickle snakes? Is it wrong to taunt badgers? What does 'wrong' really mean anyway? Isn't 'wrong' just 'right' with four letters different?
	68CE3A1A	I don't work out or nothin
	6ED437EA	30
	6BC92915	MALCOMseX
	7C4D24E8	Liberty City
	8BB84ECF	Straight!
	8B814BB4	Beer and partying! Alll- right! I love my dog man, I can really talk to him, he's called Hamish, 'cause my buddies were like, Call him Hamish dude! and I was like, That's hilarious man.
	9064B105	I've had a hard upbringing but that don't mean I don't got no education. I got my smarts on the streets and in books, not in the class room. I done some bad things but I love my momma and I ain't never disrespected no women.
	8CF33CFC	28
	81961368	I like to treat a lady right. Everybody is beautiful in their own way. I can see that. Every woman is a delicate flower that should be held up and put on display in front of the world.
	7E7FCE82	Troy Harder
	8845E20E	Colonel Cuddles
	843F79AF	With my guns and your rack, we should get together
	E9974648	PR
	E92B4598	I'm not too fond of people who don't get their facts straight about our nation's proud history, it's just laziness. I mean, would George Washington have gotten anywhere if he'd been all like "Whatever mister, where's the gift shop?" - He sure wouldn't!
	EC238CFF	Celebrities. Being fabulous. Getting pampered. Singing along to Burlesque musicals. The usual stuff. I've heard a lot of people talking about this whole "work" thing. It really doesn't sound like my scene. I'm not going to lie. I want a free ride. I figure that going out with you is probably going to be hard work so why don't you pay me a salary to do it. It'll be worth your while ; )
	EBC2E7C0	For the last 10 years I've been looking for someone to make me feel whole again. I've travelled all over Europe and now I'm in America, but I still haven't found them.
	E6111946	Cool bars. Hot clubs.
	E553330A	Hot
	E863D3ED	Algonquin
	E84D055A	A woman who dresses right and knows what a man wants. I like basketball and the smell of a woman's excitement on my sheets. I like it when a woman enjoys herself - that's what I'm here for.
	EC50111A	Bad shoes. Stupid hair.
	F8CBE2D6	I came to Liberty City to find someone, maybe it's you.
	F899BE57	I like poetry, baths, disco, really catty responses to innocuous questions.
	FD642F80	I am a simple guy. I care for my family and those who are close to me. I want to be successful here in this city. I am not greedy. I do not pretend that anything other than hard work will get me ahead in life. I look for a woman who can tell me when I am going in the wrong direction and will help me make the right choices.

	B89DCB7C	39
	C129E585	I was born in the wild forests of southern Africa, until the white man came and we were forced to flee from our natural habitat. I wandered north, learned how to use basic tools and in short time, became an animator.
	BEB67083	Grad Student
	B177D64E	Weird balls. People who take money and go into hiding and think they ain't ever going to be found (joke). Hot women, titties, all that straight shit. America's Next Top Hooker - if they did that show with rent boys maybe I'd watch it.
	B083D41E	Student
	B67BE03A	People who are financially challenged, members of the fat liberation movement, or aesthetically inferior. That's poor people, fat people, and ugly people in American. You get the picture. If you want to get with me you better have the looks and the dollars to back it up!!!
	B5EECF0F	I'm trapped in some kind of suburban nightmare where no one is interested in art or culture or anything that might elevate them above their Rusty Brown donut boxes and dumb ass violent video games. I'm looking for someone who doesn't have cholesterol where their soul should be.
	C18D549C	SweetBellic
	D982433F	Sweetie, I'll tell you all about me when and if we go on a date. If I reply to you, you are going to love what you see, trust me. Chances are though, you're a fat desperate old guy who can only afford to eat at Burger Shot. Guess what? If that's you, French Tom is going to say bon voyage. I like money and I like defined muscles.
	D7029669	All American pecs
	E2124E0A	Student
	DFFDB33D	Shy women. Women who are closed off to the world and to new experiences. Women who freak out when a man takes out his video camera. Women who don't believe a man when he says 'No, this won't go on the internet, trust me.'
	CA316EA3	21
	C1E28703	Broker
	D5CF9EE1	Anyone who believes that a man born into an oppressor's chains will never amount to nothing. Anyone who subscribes to the lies fed to us by the ruling class. People who ain't gangsta. Bitches who don't put out.
	D52162C1	The American dream. 9 to 5 jobs, people who threaten my family.
	19A12683	Women who want to take away my freedom with abortions and leg hair. Hybrid cars. Poor people who refuse to help themselves. Gun control. Fat filmmakers who hate freedom. The big gay media conspiracy.
	1966A3FF	I'm an honest, straight-up guy looking for a woman. Definitely a woman.
	1C07A911	Insecurity and low self-esteem come together on LoveMeet. Lonely women find me here.

	163E7B4B	Pathetic in-jokes.
	15A89E66	Hustler
	16A79E81	Alll-Right! Yeah!!!!!
	168FE1DF	Girls who aren't afraid to let go and let their most basic instincts take over. Girls who will go wild and reach the height of their sexual vitality. Flexibility, openness, low self esteem, the desire to get back at boyfriends / husbands / fathers.
	1CE0ACDA	Educator
	27B406C8	Good, old fashioned heterosexuality
	263B5CB4	I'm a Media Studies grad-student, doing my thesis on the positive, values message of the 1980s 'buddy movie'. I'm looking for a woman who isn't too girly, enjoys watching gladiator movies, preferably with short hair and maybe even a brother I can go fishing with.

	1F360B9B	Men with guns (I mean cut arms not, like, actual weapons)
	1561BB01	I'm a political guy and I'm looking for a woman who shares my ideals. I believe every American deserves the freedom to get into their SUV, drive to their office with its state of the art metal detectors and work sixty hours a week for a boss they've never seen, knowing all the while that a well-funded military is keeping their 46-inch TV safe from crack addicts.
	07D6F811	Athletic
	03BA97B3	Well, gee, there isn't much to tell. I work as a tour guide and educator, guiding people around our country's rich history of all-out brother against brother warfare where military-industrial might was pitted against hearth, home and an unswerving belief in the inequality of the negro.
	0A97E6B0	The Nickmeister
	0A6085C3	Oh la la!
	019AD059	Girls. Flexability.
	0076DB31	24
	03927A66	Not calling me back. Bad dress sense. Bad shoes. Stupid hair. Lame music. Flabby bods. Empty nightclubs, unless they're empty because they're too cool to let people in. If that's the case then it's ok.
	021338E6	Cool bars and hot clubs. The freedom to do what I like all day and the security of a man's arms around me at night. An English accent, an Italian cook and a Latino dancer (one at a time or all at once). The gym.

	0FB379AE	37
	0E070F27	Political fundraiser

	127E7220	My truest passion is the American Civil War, I'm looking for my own little soldier's wife.

	0B829A2A	Dukes
	0CBADDFE	Matte Black
	0CA2CE05	Need to have big arms. Defined delts, lats, and triceps a must! Money. Dollar bills, baby! All that shit. Men who let me pay the check. Bling. Bodies. Hell yeah! Don't mind people who use bull shark testosterone as long as they don't have funny balls.

	4E19D0F2	In my spare time I like to take part in re-enactments of famous battles from the War Between the States, we allow women to take part dressed as wives and nurses now too! We charge a small fee to take part and I've always said if the army was like that - we could put an end to war! Which would be a tragedy.
	4DEE5455	Shy women.
	5C139269	30

	5C2FAB77	Entrepreneur
	5C215B59	21

	5C37F0E8	Oppressors.
	44C1394B	I don't want to be put in some 'category'
	317297A4	I like to party when I'm not studying, just go to a club on my own and cut loose, really have some me time, surrounded by two or three hundred other men doing the same thing. I like actors who can stand up for their own heterosexuality without being thought of as some gay, paranoid, midget cult member.
