	C3B55BA1	Hola chicas! Guess what! I went out for dinner with Cort tonight. The restaurant was muy trendy and full of the coolest people. I looked smoking in my black Derriere dress and knee-boots. I put some gloss on my cleavage (hot tip, girls!) so that my puppies would glisten in the candle light. I don't know what they put in lobster but it makes me so horny. Maybe it's just because it's so expensive... I made him come with my foot under the table... it was sooooo romantic. I think that he might be the one. Our waitress was a little on the chubby side and looked so out of place, poor thing. I saw the envy in her eyes as she ran her eyes over my rock-hard body and it got me thinking how many girls must long to BE ME. It is easy to forget sometimes how interesting my life must be to all my readers. I promise to post more often. Toodles for now.
	C522EA34	Mike says: I want to paddle you
	BDF24352	Can you believe some of the lines I get from guys on Instant message?
	C0F114A7	We watched some hilarious stand-up by this English guy called Ricky Gervais. He was SO checking me out during his performance. They're not used to girls like me in England. Have you ever seen their soap operas?!! Lots of miserable hags sitting around in smoky pubs moaning about their lives. I've often thought that I could be a comedian. Lots of people tell me that I'm the funniest person they know. I certainly think so. Axxxxx
	C65CF5BA	It turns out he knows Trent and that my ping pong ball trick is the talk of the racket club! How funny!! I ended up going back to his place in Suffolk with another guy called Steve. Tres stylish loft. They both took turns and then called me a taxi. I felt like a princess. On the way home, I started to think about the person I am and the person I want to be. Does love really matter or is a three-way enough?
	CB1158AE	Apparently, he's huge at the moment (career-wise, anyway). Money and fame get me dripping faster than some lube and an electric toothbrush. I might go back there tomorrow in a little black dress and some strappy sandals. Anyway, must dash - my personal trainer arrives in half an hour and I need to glitter up my landing strip. He's hung like a racehorse that guy! I'm looking forward to a punishing workout. Not that I'll remember any of it... I just necked a fifth of bourbon and half a bottle of Silencers. Toodles!!!!!!!
	CB235912	Wow I look good today. My skin has an amazing glow to it. The doorman was SO checking me out again as I left the apartment building. It must be awful to be ugly and poor. It took me about 5 hours to put together my outfit this morning. Getting the right combination of vintage and couture can be a real challenge and that mystery red pill I found in the bathroom cabinet didn't seem to speed up the process.
	C87A0CD4	Take a deep breath. I've got some bad news, girls. I can't keep pretending it never happened. I should have told you before, I know, but Niko is in the hospital! Que horror! I've haven't had a guy die on me since that judge in the honeymoon suite at Opium Nights. A 68-year-old man, a gram of special K and my tight little ass was always going to be a recipe for disaster. That reminds me; I've got to make sure the kid never manages to track me down through his adoptive parents.
	C9217109	Retarded!
	B2B12CD0	Bonjour!
	B35CC6A8	Mike says: U dum ho
	A2892D3E	I think the only way I'm going to be able to get through this is to drink wine with Heidi and Paige and quip sardonically about the complexity of modern relationships. Then black out and have sex with a random stranger. Sometimes you don't know what you had until it's gone. Sometimes you don't know where you are for a couple of days. Sometimes you don't remember writing your blog. Nobody said it was easy being a party girl. Alex xxx
	A9717801	Well, at least one of us is getting showered with expensive gifts. The only thing that I've been showered with recently is the urine of that pervy fitness instructor. Niko didn't even show up for our date today. There must have been some kind of terrible misunderstanding or accident.
	B54752BA	Ok, it's time to come clean. I was trying to protect you but there's no point in hiding this any longer. I think that Niko might be dead! It's such a blur and I still don't really know what happened. Coherent recollection is near impossible on these new meds. He's in the hospital now, fighting for his life. Fighting for love.
	B87F970F	I was thinking earlier that my life is like a Vinewood blockbuster where I'm the star and the blogosphere is one big movie theater full of low income women sharing bargain soda&popcorn combos and dreaming of being me. Now that's what I call a metaphor! I really have been taking my prose to a different level in the past couple of weeks. If only my English teacher could see me now! By the way, thanks for that A+, Mr. Hopkins, but a word of advice - it wouldn't kill you to wash your balls once in a while. It smelt like week-old roadkill down there!
	BD9CC297	LiberatedWoman says: I am on fire
	B5F0E451	I'm spring cleaning today in my booty shorts, just because I can. My neighbor came round earlier to borrow some milk and was checking me out so badly. I am sure that all I had to do was touch him and we would have been fucking on the carpet. I think that he's in love with me. His name is John and he's an architect. I invited him over for a glass of wine tonight. One glass... yeah right! I know that I'll probably get shloshed and seduce him. i might wear my tennis outfit and do some coke to make my face flushed. I've never played but the little skirts drive guys wild. My thighs are so taut right now.
	B737D770	Sweet dreams!!!!xxx

	E7FA2FE2	LiberatedWoman says: Are you retarded?
	EECFF064	Girls! My Mysterious European took me out to a comedy club today. I was all geared up for a night of champagne and violent sex in the back of a limo but you can't expect every date to be perfect. Did I tell you that I have mastered the art of purging and snorting coke at the same time, btw? I am in and out of the restroom in less than 10 seconds these days.
	FAC45576	Mike says: No
	FBBA3EE1	Mike says: What R U wearing?
	EED934B4	It was fun while it lasted but he was so beneath me, it's unreal. And he had the nerve to call me unstable. No, it's auf wiedersehen to you, Mr. Bellitch. I'm didn't get to the top of every VIP list by dating men who order from the first page of the wine list. You win some, you lose some. There's always another married investment banker waiting in the wings to screw a girl like me during his lunchhour. I'm just glad that the endless glitz and glamour that is my life, brings some meaning to yours. Snaring a husband in Algonquin is my number 1 priority. No more drunken encounters with random men off craplist. From now on, my panties are staying up until I see evidence of a second home and a black High Life card. Oh, who am I trying to kid?! Sexual promiscuity defines me as a strong, independent woman.
	F639E853	I'll get Daddy on the case. It seems like so long ago now. So does this morning, though. When you start your day with a handful of Silencers, by lunch your breakfast feels like it happened some time last year. Not that I eat breakfast or lunch but you know what I mean. Anyway, my Mysterious European is on his deathbed! The doctors are doing all they can but I'm not sure he's going to make it. Talk about a disaster date. I'm going to run myself a bubblebath and try to forget about the bloodbath. If I could feel anything, I'm sure that I would be devastated. Nitey night! xxxxx
	D2426710	Hola! Guess where your favorite party girl ended up today? At a comedy club! How deliciously tacky and low-end is that? It was Niko's idea and I was too jacked up on painkillers to argue. I thought that I was going to hate it but it turned out to be good fun. Katt Williams did this brilliant stand-up routine - like me, he seems to be tapped into the zeitgeist of popular culture, albeit in a different social echelon.
	D3860D4E	Talk about a HANGOVER!!! Paige invited me to this hot new bar on Middle Park East last night. No point in moping around at home, right girls?! A few bottles of champagne and a mountain of powder later and Heidi's wearing her ankles for earrings and my face is buried in some tres fine Egyptian cotton pillows. They were both lawyers. Watch this space!
	CCF902F6	DARLINGS!!!
	CF856668	Mike says: Really?
	D6408C6F	Mike says: Have a cam?
	DE0E9AE3	Are there no single men left in Liberty City? Another night without a date! Que horror! I've decided that I'm going to stay in and give Valentino a rose bath and then practice that cute little smile that I do when I wrinkle my nose.
	E09B1838	You combine model looks with intellectual depth and what do you have? A woman with a duty to share herself with the world. Sometimes I just sit there and think, like a college professor or something. I stare at nothing, full of vague recollections and flickering images. Big news, btw! My fling with the Mysterious European is officially flung. I mean, let's not beat around the bush - a guy like him and a girl like me were never going to last. My tampons are custom-made, for fuck sake! My lunch bill probably costs more than his rent. My girlie laugh and collection of strappy shoes are envied by women the world over.
	DB328DCF	Off the top of my head, I can't actually think of anyone who ticks all the boxes like me. I'd have to play myself, I think. And direct. I've often thought that I could be a film-maker. I find that I am able to visualize a lot. I see something happen in a shop or a nightclub and I think to myself - wow, Alex, I can totally imagine recording that on a camera and playing it back on a screen. Can you see my perfectly-shaped calves sashaying up the red carpet at the Oscars? Of course you can. What a week! How incredibly wild is my life in comparison with yours?!!!!
	DD5EFD89	Speaking of mystery, Niko hasn't been returning any of my calls, which is strange. Why are men so intimidated by brains and beauty? I'm only compatible with alpha males of obscene wealth and I'm starting to worry that Niko might be a beta male of disgustingly-moderate means. And do you want to hear something really funny? Paige reckons she saw Niko driving a cab! Er, whatever babe! Considering she vomits on an hourly basis and hasn't been sober since the late 80s, I find it best to take all her observations with a large pinch of salt. And a large pinch of snow.
	35184131	When your life is an endless whirlwind of heels, cocktails and rich men, sometimes it is easy to forget that you're a neo-feminist. Getting a man to take you shopping in Paris for the weekend and then never answering his calls. Giving a guy a handjob in exchange for free drinks and coke all night in Maisonette 9. Don't let men control you, girls. Take back the power. Talk loudly about penis size with your girlfriends. We are not shallow whores well past our prime! We are liberated women. We're changing the world one gin-and-tonic at a time.
	37A14E07	Mike says: I have a red catsuit
	2F5F08A5	Wow. What a night! Talk about a martini fest! Heidi, Paige and I went out on the hunt for investment bankers. I have set myself a deadline of next summer for the wedding and the clock is ticking! We walked straight to the front of the line, as usual. All the doormen in Liberty City know us! A handjob can get you a long way in this town. Within a couple of minutes, Heidi had spotted a table of diamante cufflinks and $1000 brogues in the VIP area and we made our move. At one point, I did my trick with the ping pong ball, the one that I learned on the pageant circuit. I met this wonderful guy called Trent. As he was fingering me at the coat check, I got to thinking... can relationships really work in the 21st century? Or are we just fumbling in the dark? Never compromise who you are, girls.
	2FF43C2C	HELLLLLOOOOO! This will have to be a quick post. I have a date tonight. Wish me luck!
	3FC6B0A8	Nothing is certain in life except death, taxes and MEN DON'T STAND UP ALEX CHILTON!!! Who does that Serbian peasant think he is? If this leaks onto the party circuit, I might never purge another canapé again. If he puts the future of my social life in jeopardy, I'll make sure he never drinks another cocktail in this town again. He should be spending every minute of every day thanking Apollo or whoever it is they worship over there for the opportunity to even breathe the same air as Alex Chilton! Is he out of his fucking mind?
	4BBAE0E9	What a bunch of whores! Flaunting themselves for money and male attention. And I was so much cuter than any of them. I wonder how often Niko goes to these places??? Maybe it's time to give him a blowjob while he's driving? That's the best way to get a man to fall in love with you. And if you suck his balls and put your finger up his ass, you are almost guaranteed a marriage proposal. Is that a little too candid for you, girls? Well, fuck it. This is the 21st century and graphic discussions about sex with your girlfriends over brunch is what defines you as a liberated woman. I'm SO happy with my thighs right now, btw. The definition is nothing short of spectacular. Ciao for now xxx
	5189542D	Even if you put my personality and intellect aside, I am a perfect 10 for fuck's sake. If there was an 11 out of 10, I'd be an 11. I can get reservations at any restaurant and VIP entry at any club. I blend vintage and modern effortlessly and I'm fairly close to being famous. Fucking country bumpkin. Well, it's his loss. I was even wearing my crotchless panties... or was I? I don't have them now, either way. Who knows? It takes me all my time to remember to get out of bed in the morning. Thank fuck for medication
	44518114	Toodles!!!!xxxxxx
	49A0EAAA	Chicas! I can't believe I forgot about this! Why do I always black out when I mix the yellow pills with the blue pills? Anyway, Niko has been arrested! Of all my many experiences with handcuffs, this has got to be the strangest. I've spent the last hour playing the ham banjo at my bedroom window while pretending that my neighbor can't see me. All this danger and suspense is a bit of a turn-on, I can tell you. Can this Mysterious European get any more mysterious? Maybe he's a mafia kingpin with millions of dollars in offshore accounts? Who would play me in the movie? Samantha Muldoon? No, she's WAY too fat.

	0C8678FA	LiberatedWoman says: Why would I be on fire?
	01765F39	My look today is very boho chic... floaty skirt, cowboy boots, chunky belt. I'm the BOMB!
	026CE39F	LiberatedWoman says: OMFG! What?
	0FBAFBC2	Trent drove me out to his place in the Carraways this weekend. We had dinner under the stars. He tied me up with a ball in my mouth and invited some of his golf buddies over. The next morning, I put my hair in pigtails and came down to breakfast in one of his white shirts. Uber sexy. He calls me his little slut bucket which is soooo sweet!! He told that me he is going to leave his wife. Fingers crossed! I'm sitting in my apartment right now, smoking a cigarette and looking out at the hustle and bustle in the streets below. Liberty City is my city and I love it!
	1834F7D6	Mike says: My name is mike
	25D5AA70	LiberatedWoman says: You need help
	130B84DC	Mike says: IRL
	1545F400	Que horror! Daddy had the nerve to suggest that I get a job. I have never been more offended in my life. I'm a visionary, I blog. Is it not more important to weave some art into life's rich tapestry, to let my creative juices seep out like a snailtrail on a black bedspread? Wow, I am on fire today. And I'm not just talking about the chlamydia. I have straddled the line between prose and poetry and I am grinding it seductively. That reminds me. I have to tell you about my date with Niko. We went to a stripclub! I KNOW! And they say romance is dead! It was quite an eye-opener for a girl of my upbringing and social standing, I can tell you. And a leg-opener.
	8EDEFDAD	Mike says: Kinky shit
	95B8E683	I'm just not meeting enough guys on the party circuit so I've decided to post another ad on craplist. A liberated woman doesn't sit back and wait for Mr. Right to come to her! Right, girls? You have to take control, put yourself out there, meet strange men in swanky bars, giggle, play with your hair and then sleep with them on the first night. Toodles. Alexxxxxx
	83ABE7A1	I worked on my calves for two hours at the gym today. Calves are sooooo important, girls! Trent hasn't called. Neither has Brad, Cort or Steve. Sometimes I think that I might be better off by myself. Just Valentino and petite little me. I guess that some men can't cope with a successful, intelligent, beautiful woman. I am Alex Chilton, goddamn it! I am the voice for a generation of liberated women. I have a great apartment, amazing shoes and an ass like a cheerleader. Most importantly, though, I have incredible friends. Remember, chicas - no matter how many times men screw you over, your girlfriends will always be there to feed you booze and light your cigarettes. Love and kisses to Heidi and Paige!!!! xxxxx
	85BA1A43	Valentino went toilet before in his Didier Sachs carrying pouch - so gross! It's amazing how much can come out of such a tiny chihuahua! Heidi tells me that the vet can do an operation to make the bowel smaller. Note to self: sort out Valentino's disgusting poop problem.
	986655EB	This is what happens when you ski off-piste. Heidi warned me about breaking with the program. I should stick to screwing married businessmen in expensive hotel suites and musing about what it means to be a modern woman. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Anyway, let's hope my Mysterious European has a VERY good excuse for his no-show. There are plenty more fish in the sea and most of them are swimming in my direction. Sweet dreams! Alex xxxx
	A2066DEE	Alex xxxxx
	A2170B8C	Mike says: That's hot
	A090210F	LiberatedWoman says: uh
	A1D34978	I'll be honest with you. I should have posted this earlier but I was too embarrassed. Why do men always have to ruin everything?!!!! I had it all planned. I was going to take Niko back to my place and crawl across the floor with my butt in the air. Slow and seductive. Like a panther but with a perfect C cup and $1000 heels. One of my signature moves. Then, he goes and gets arrested! Oh, the shame of it! What if somebody saw me?!!
	581E193E	I went to the hippest after-party in Liberty City tonight. Everyone who's anyone in the fashion industry was there. One of Daddy's partners invited me. I think that he wants to make love to me. Actually he already has, according to Heidi, but I was zoned on painkillers and Cherenkov at the time. Hehe! Actually, that reminds me - Daddy needs to clear my credit card balance again. I hooked up with this music producer called Brad.
	5AF015C4	LiberatedWoman says: Um, is this thing still on?
	52DD2B8D	It doesn't even bear thinking about. I mean, I'm all for a bit of spontaneity and excitement on a date. A blowjob in the elevator. A line of toot off a stripper's clit. A crocodile clip and some candle wax. But not this. Anything but this. I'm terrified! What do I really know about this guy? He could be a murderer or a rapist or anything. Maybe he's a fan whose masturbatory fantasy has morphed into a sadistic obsession? He wouldn't be the first. This is a disaster. My life is in danger and I'm out of tranks. I'm going to call up my personal trainer. I can't sleep alone tonight...
	5746D13A	If you learn one thing from me today (and you will probably learn more than one), NEVER leave the house without full makeup, lacy underwear and dusting your landing strip with glitter.
	6C2A3838	Mike says: I am a school principal
	746D0B7E	Newsflash girls!!! I had a casual encounter with a man from craplist tonight! Well, I say casual. As you know, Alex Chilton doesn't do casual! My nightgown probably costs more than your car. You cannot predict when Mr. Right is going to come into your life and some slapdash mascara or a pair of old jeans could be the difference between a million-dollar engagement ring and living out your days as a barren, alcoholic spinster.
	7BCA9CB4	I'm wearing skinny jeans, ballet pumps and a low-cut cashmere sweater. SMOKING HOT! So what's new? Paige got a diamond necklace from this guy she's blowing which is 100% fab and gorgeous. Five figures at least. We all screamed and jumped up and down for about 20 minutes while looking around to see if any guys were checking us out.
	6E14FED6	Anyway, it turned out that this guy from craplist was a 70-year-old with a prosthetic leg and breath like dog shit. The old perv had sent me his grandson's photo! But the restaurant was top-notch and I was looking smoking hot in a vintage ballerina skirt, Le Chien chiffon blouse and Enema cowboy boots so I decided to pound the martinis and make the best of it. And guess what?!! He's got more money than a third-world country! Never judge a book by its cover - that's what I always say. As his cracked lips parted and his rancid tongue flicked at the back of my tonsils, I thought to myself... is money enough? Could I fall for a man who wets himself during the appetizer and sleeps through dessert? If he continues to order $700 bottles of wine, then the answer might just be yes. SIGH. When did relationships become so complicated? xxxxxxx
	736BF5A7	Sorry that I haven't posted for a while. Missed me?
