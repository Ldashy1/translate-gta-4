	B9D32D62	Sociologists and other irrelevant academics have begun to furiously debate the question on everyone's lips - web 2.0: is it interesting, or not? It seems no one can decide. Certainly people turning their lives into content for everyone else to watch online and then turn into their own content for others to listen to and blog about has taken art and broadcasting from the elite to the masses. Is it in fact one of the most boring things we've ever witnessed?

One anthropologist noted, "Web 2.0 is a revelation - there's no doubt about it - or the fact is my career has gone nowhere as a serious academic so I'm now doing a paper on the internet in a bid to get some TV appearances and tenure that way. My next book will have a controversial title, and probably feature tits." The debate continues, until someone stops the funding.
