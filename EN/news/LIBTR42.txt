	A8660BB8	Accusations of child labor continue
	8E0149CA	Club Owner Appeals For Vice
	8A7F968B	Nightlife king, "Gay" Tony Prince spoke out yesterday after he had two clubs closed by the city. He said that the city should not try to turn itself into a version of the Midwest. Mr. Prince, who has run clubs in the city for 25 years, been to rehab 5 times, and also incarcerated for tax evasion, commented, "I don't have a traditional family. I don't care about family values. That's why l live and work in Liberty City. If I wanted to go to bed at 8pm and worry about noise and hate people who weren't identical to me, I would go and live in Ohio. Nothing against Ohio. I went there once. I just used it as an example. Liberty City is supposed to be threatening and dangerous and challenging. Right now, it's about as challenging as a dog show." The LCPD spokesman we interviewed noted, "Mr. Prince's clubs were violating 8 city ordinances, and were undoubtedly places where drugs were being consumed. He is lucky he is not back in jail."

Starve or earn 10 cents an hour? 401k and gym membership isn't going to put food on their floor. Children require less sleep and women are better at multi-tasking. It's simply good business sense. We spend billions every year on advertising and celebrity endorsements and that has to come from somewhere." The battle over morality vs. overpriced sports fashion continues to rage. Many of Eris's sponsored athletes came out in support of the company, saying they were each getting paid $10 million to wear the logo and the human rights scandal is overblown.

Mayor Ochoa has to keep to his word and do something about this problem. Until then, the helpless residents of Liberty City must remain at the mercy of these foreign thugs.

	2DC2CB69	Bobby Jefferson, the Ex-Secretary of Security Enforcement, came to Liberty City in order to give a speech on the increasing threat of immigrant-led organized crime. However, Jefferson became a victim himself as his convoy was ambushed on the way to the Civic Citadel and he was nearly killed. Violent crime is becoming more and more prevalent in this city and people like Mr. Jefferson are asking why in highly paid speeches. The RICO statutes and the pressure put on organized crime by new forms of surveillance has for years undermined the traditional criminal elements in this city. This void is being filled by hungry and ruthless criminals coming into our city from abroad.
