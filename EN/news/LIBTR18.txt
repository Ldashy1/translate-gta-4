	96B574DF	Menotti is just one of a number of mobsters who have recently turned on their fellow criminals in exchange for lenient sentencing. While some applaud the efforts of the FIB, others think that the convictions are futile. Ex-Secretary of Security Enforcement, Bobby Jefferson, had this to say, "There's always going to be organized crime. The mob in Liberty City is being weakened, but it's just opening up room for new gangsters coming to town. The Alderney-based mobsters are trying to take control of Liberty City rackets and gangsters are coming in from Eastern Europe. These guys are even worse than the likes of Vito Dog Meat. There's a lot of money in Liberty City and officials willing to be bought off, so there'll always be crooks here trying to take advantage of the situation. It's unfortunately the dark side of human nature."

	E02E8CB5	This city used to be great - there was a time when people could party themselves half to death any night of the week and tourists actually wanted to visit Liberty City so they could OD in the capital of the world. Now, thanks to the thought police, people would rather go somewhere it is not illegal to have fun. They are trying to turn this place into a suburb. I cannot stand it." Mr. Prince, known in nightlife circles as "Gay Tony" once spent three months in prison for tax evasion and has been to rehab 6 times. He has consistently denied links to organized crime in his clubs, or that he socializes with known mobsters.

	0A7CE151	Night Club impresario, Tony Prince, the man behind fabled night spots of yesteryear such as Peacock, Platonic Fury, Cox, and currently owner of Hercules, spoke out yesterday against the LCPD and their overzealous policing of night clubs: "The idea that somehow clubs lead to social decline is simply not true. Liberty City should be the world leader in nocturnal entertainment, and it no longer is, because the police keep stopping us from doing any business. First it was underage drinking, then it was drugs, then dancing licenses; now it's smoking, sex, poor music, too many ice cubes in the drinks - you name it, they try to regulate it.

	4C7F6074	Vito "Dog Meat" Menotti stood in front of a judge at the Civic Citadel today in order to give evidence against his fellow mobsters. Menotti, having admitted to a series of murders here in Liberty City in the early 90s, has accepted a plea deal from the DA. This will allow him to gain a new identity in the witness relocation program in some horrible town in a desert state, providing his testimony leads to the conviction of his criminal cohorts. Mr. Menotti, a long-time senior-ranking member of Pavano crime family, gained his moniker from his ownership of a dog food processing plant. Menotti now admits that this gruesome plant was a good means of laundering money and disposing of the unfortunate victims of his mob hits.
