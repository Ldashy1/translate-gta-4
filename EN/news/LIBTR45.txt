	D17AC439	In what is no doubt an enormous embarrassment to relatives, police have announced that the recent death of Philipo Cantalato was due to an internal explosion. Part of the growing community of webcam users who gather to chat about beauty and fashion and bleach their stinky stovepipes online, Cantalato was attempting to singe the hairs near his Winking Walnut when an unplanned gas expulsion resulted in an explosion that raced up through Catalato's large intestine. "This fascination with the back door is not healthy," said Families Forever director, Mandy Shoren, "It distracts from what's important, and that's a good face to face vaginal pounding."

	CFCDE454	Arch conservative and political gay basher, Bryce Dawkins, was yesterday hiding in rehab after he was discovered to have a double life. As well as a wife and children, Mr. Dawkins also had a boyfriend whom he kept in an apartment that the city financed. Photographs have emerged of Mr. Dawkins kissing Bernie Crane, his guest. Mr. Dawkins released a statement that read, "I am 100% heterosexual. Things look bad, but the evidence is just circumstantial. I do however have a substance abuse problem, which I am dealing with and I also have been addicted to bad behaviors, including visiting lap dancing clubs. I love women. Look at my wife. She's satisfied. Please leave my family alone. We need privacy. I (will) continue to stand up for what I believe in, even if I am just a man and a work in progress. I'm not gay and I never have been. Quite the opposite. I just have a soft spot for sad people who need looking after.

	08B5C38F	Police have found the body of Alderney mob boss, Jimmy Pegorino, on Happiness Island. Mr. Pegorino had captured headlines as the boss of a crime family with designs on power. They were thought to be seeking parity with the Five Families who had been weakened in recent years. After recent legal pressure and escalating bloodbaths in Alderney, crime pundits began to see Pegorino's crew as pretenders, not the real thing. Police responded to reports of both a boat and helicopter crash on Happiness Island. Three suspects were witnessed leaving the scene and are being sought for questioning.
