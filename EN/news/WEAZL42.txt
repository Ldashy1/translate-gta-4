	859F4B85	One War We Are Winning: The War On Fun
	A2C64B6F	Shoe Liberals!
	56B8A3F9	Thankfully, we are not complete losers. We've almost won one war - fun has almost been defeated. Nightclub-owning degenerate, Tony Prince, noted yesterday that Liberty City has been transformed into a strip mall. And not before time. The quicker we shut all of the night clubs there the better. Fun can be stopped, and we will prove it.
	5C01FE4A	The unfortunate truth is that tree-huggers would rather see third-world communities unemployed and homeless than working for a successful corporation. An Indonesian child is not going to thank a dreadlocked middle-class hippy for closing down her only source of income and sending her back to a life of crime, prostitution and cannibalism.

	B4735F6D	Some strategists are saying that, "We should focus on this war, so we don't make the same mistake as the Nazis and try to fight a war on two fronts. Let's defeat fun first then focus on everything else we hate, like Europe."
	4A4F5AE5	In an online missive that delivers a powerful blow to the heart of the liberal manifesto, Vassal poses the hard-hitting questions that most in our politically-correct society no longer dare to ask, such as, "What would you rather do? Starve or earn 10 cents an hour?"
	1E496B65	Firstly, if people are going to come over to our country they should adopt to our customs of growing obese and loving bad sitcoms. Also, learn our language, even if we haven't quite properly mastered it yet. They shouldn't go somewhere like Hove Beach which is more Russian than some parts of Moscow. If these guys are such a threat, then why don't we just close the borders to everyone? I say close the borders to these bastards. Remember, 9 in 10 terrorists are foreign too.
	1FA80597	For years, sneaker manufacturer Eris has been made the villain by work-shy lefties for choosing to help third world countries. Historically, Eris's visionary founder, Pete Vassal, has kept quiet, refusing to descend to the level of veggie hypocrites who are more than happy to take a welfare check from the same government that they profess to despise. However, after years of silence, Vassal has now chosen to speak out against the rants of stoned human rights activists the world over.
	0BE24697	Alright, so Bobby Jefferson went out of his way to praise some immigrants while he was damning others in his speech at the Civic Citadel. He argued that 99% of the people who come into this country are honest (I'd like to see the statistics to back that one up, by the way) and believe in the same things that patriotic American citizens do. He then went on to say that, besides terrorism, the biggest threat to American safety at the moment is these gangsters coming into Liberty City from Russia and Eastern Europe and setting up shop in immigrant communities like Hove Beach.
