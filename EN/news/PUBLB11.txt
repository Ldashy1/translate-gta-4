A midnight snack of frozen French fries, pizzas with mustard and fishstick bacon omelets will trigger the intelligent engine and send an email to mom and dad that their child is most likely high as shit. If the e-fridge 5000 detects that it hasn't been accessed by your daughter in a few days, an eating disorder alert will be sent. The price is planned at $6,000.
