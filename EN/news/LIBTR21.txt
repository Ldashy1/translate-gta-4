	B7D47268	A Lawyer, Tom Goldberg, was murdered in his high security Algonquin office today. Mr. Goldberg was believed to be engaged in pursuing corruption charges against high ranking members of the LCPD along with several members of City Hall. Previously, Mr. Goldberg had been involved in cases against the mafia, class action suits against food companies and also won a case against the Strike Lite match company for failing to put a warning on their matches that the product could cause fire if used correctly. In a moment of hubris, he also unsuccessfully sued God for letting it rain on his parade. The killer gained entrance to the offices of Goldberg, Ligner and Shyster where Mr. Goldberg was a partner. Dick Shyster, another partner in the firm, eulogized Mr. Goldberg in a press release, "Tom will be sorely missed by all the people he got off. I'll be taking over a lot of his cases, so hopefully I'll get a media profile as big as his and eventually run for political office myself."
	9A649F59	We could not reach a member of The Lost Motorcycle Club for comment but a spokesperson for the Angels of Death denied any member involvement in this altercation. He claimed that they are, "just a bunch of guys who like to get together, get drunk and then ride choppers. We keep our noses clean." If lines of methamphetamine have a sanitizing effect, then this guy might be right.
	9A216D91	Liberty City's serial killer struck again yesterday with the news that the body of a man had been recovered who'd had his limbs and genitals removed. This time, however, unlike other victims, the head remained intact. The victim was a white male, although police have not yet released a name.

	FBB861FF	The Police Commissioner has stated that, besides terrorists and peaceful political protest we don't approve of, the next biggest threat to civic order within Liberty City is motorcycle gangs. A recent barroom shootout resulted in several young Asian men dead at the hands of leather-clad, bike-riding harbingers of death.

	28C50ADA	This change in strategy makes the already fraught task of naming the serial killer much more difficult. Police are baffled about this dangerous turn of events, while the city lives in dread. One Dukes resident noted, "What does it say about our police department that they can't even name a serial killer? What must the Midwest think of us now? It's pathetic. The police chief should be beheaded, never mind these poor victims."
