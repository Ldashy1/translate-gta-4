	802E6623	It's the taboo subject no one had thought of: Gays in the Fire Department. It's not a subject most people had worried about, but, according to Mr. Dawkins, the communal showers at most fire stations make men feel awkward. "Updating the showers to something where people can't openly stare longingly at each other's genitals would cost money and it's money I'd rather spend on protecting our city from terrorism," he said patriotically. And so say all of us. Thank you, Mr. Dawkins, for keeping it real.

	4EC78356	Committed family man and public servant, Bryce Dawkins, is the kind of man who spreads fear into our enemies and shows why this IS the greatest country the world has ever seen. Why? Because he says it how he sees it, not how some liberal drug-addled elite want him to say it. He spoke out yesterday over exactly the kind of thing that gives our enemies strength, and weakens our ability to respond when the unthinkable happens (for those who don't know and have been living under a rock these past 6 years, the unthinkable is obvious - foreigners trying to kill us before we kill them).
