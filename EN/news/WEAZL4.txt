	58AE7522	There is a market for luxury living. People work hard on the stock market in the Exchange in order to come home and hear the sound of flowing champagne in a golden fountain on their living room floor. They want to be waited on by Yusuf Amir's team of chefs, butlers, Reiki practitioners, friends for hire and plastic surgeons because their busy schedules do not allow them to go out and find these services for themselves. Amir's development represents everything that the successful entrepreneur deserves after a hard day at the office. Investing in this property is an investment in the American economy. Leftist loons are trying to shut it down and, you know what? This reporter thinks that that is wholly un-American.
	2AF819B6	Why do attempts to bring this kind of class and distinction to American soil always grind to a halt? Who are these local groups insistent upon whingeing about big business and necessary developments? Is this a secular progressive conspiracy to stop bringing money into Liberty City from overseas? Would these leftist loons rather the deservedly wealthy residents of Liberty City gave their money to war-dodging Frenchmen in Paris than Yusuf Amir here in Liberty City?
	3DE7BF95	Yusuf Amir, the renowned property developer, has run into issues when attempting to build a luxury condo tower in Liberty City. Aside from teething problems with union representatives, local groups are complaining that this development will ruin the skyline in Castle Gardens. Yusuf is a personal friend of this reporter and his name is synonymous with opulence and luxury throughout the world. His most notable achievement was the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Amir - an apartment complex suspended from balloons over the Persian Gulf.
