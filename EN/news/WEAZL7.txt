	9576E287	A win for freedom as new laws will be enforced.
	81D1D0D0	Love it or Leave it
	A331930E	Freedom restored with Jingoism Act
	EE97A24F	Otherwise, an important part of our population is going to suffer unfairly - the wealthy will be punished again as they have to pick up the tab for the government's mismanagement of the economy and the war on terror. We have said it before on Weazel: we are a nuclear power; we should blitz the economy and our enemies.
	B03C6EE7	Will wealthy investors foot the bill for the war on terror?
	3E3DC19A	It's the news our enemies love - the terrible price of freedom - the catastrophe of the falling stock market. The BAWSAQ has been in freefall the last few days, and it's the kind of news that makes terrorists rejoice and liberals wonder how they can interfere to bring prices down further. It's a natural consequence of years of over-regulation, big government and the killing of the entrepreneurial spirit that made this country the envy of foreigners everywhere. The country will enter a serious recession and be governed by a combination of Islamic terrorists, homosexuals and communists unless action is taken immediately - the government must cut the highest rate of income tax for the rich, abolish capital gains tax and liberate the rich to make investments wherever they see fit.

	479381B4	As terrorists try to blow up our way of life and our Rusty Brown's stores, Congress took the courageous move today and passed the Jingoism Act, bringing back some much needed sanity into a country that has lost its way. Family values will be mandatory under the new law, and sodomy has been outlawed completely except in rare cases. Citizens are required to submit their email passwords to their local police to assist in tracking down those who would do harm to our country. Since the liberals desperately want the terrorists to win, this is a goose step in the right direction.
