	FB212768	Steroid Scandal Rocks Baseball As Swingers Team Admits Low Dosages
	E3BDFA01	Passengers on the subway between Algonquin and Dukes saw an unusual sight earlier - members of The Lost biker gang in a dramatic fight for their lives. The bikers entered the tunnel system in North Holland and sped along the tracks at high speed, weaving between oncoming trains and exchanging gunfire. An unconfirmed witness reports that there were three bikes involved in the chase. Two bodies have so far been recovered. One being identified as Jim Fitzgerald, a member of the Alderney chapter of The Lost. Police are struggling to identify the other one. Authorities are appealing to other members of The Lost and their rival biker club, the Angels of Death, for any information.

	802DAAF5	Team owners are considering firing the Swingers head coach as the steroid scandal grows. Some key players weren't taking any steroids at all while others were only taking 50% of the maximum dosage. "This is absolutely unacceptable," said a statement from the team's owners, "The Swingers are here to play baseball and win games. Coaches are expected to push players to the limit, both physically and pharmacologically." Most fans agree after the several seasons of poor performance by the Swingers organization.

Fans of the movie franchise often dress as their favorite character from the movie and speak in Middle English. Police say the fans argue over movie minutia within the smallest point of trivia sometimes leading to violent conflict. The assailant in the altercation is still being sought by police, but witnesses say he was dressed in a jester costume and playing a lute when he got involved in an argument with the victim about whether it was a realistic plot point that a dragon could breed with a horse. The argument turned violent with the jester seizing the victim's sword and fatally wounding him. Police are requesting any court jesters in the area to come forward voluntarily so that they can eliminate them from their inquiries.
