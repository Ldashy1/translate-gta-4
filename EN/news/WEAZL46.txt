	D574E3BD	Fans of the Deputy Mayor have been devastated by new scandal
	F1923648	Tragic Revelations
	F2C15E7D	Bryce Dawkins Was Closet Liberal
	644242D5	Leslie Mitchell
	2BAB1D53	Now, he's also come out as a homosexual, married with children. Well, it's scarcely surprising. He's a liberal. Wooly thinking is their watchword. Or watch words. This news organization can never be accused of wooly thinking (apart from our weird attitude to China, but let's ignore that), so we will continue to attack liberals like him, until we have driven them out of this country for good.
	38A0373D	Why do we think this? Mr. Dawkins admitted he took pity on Mr. Crane and gave him somewhere to stay. If this isn't an awful example of people expecting state handouts, I don't know what is. Quite frankly, I think we'd all prefer it if Mr. Crane was Mr. Dawkins' lover. It is an awful example to set. Pity is for the weak.
	5C64FEC6	Disgraced sinner, Bryce Dawkins, was hiding a terrible secret. He lived a double life. In public, he was a staunch hang 'em and flog 'em conservative, but in private, he was a filthy liberal. The fact is Mr. Dawkins was not as conservative as he made out. He even owned a passport. Most terrorists own passports, as do many drug dealers.
