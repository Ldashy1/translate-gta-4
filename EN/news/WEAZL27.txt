	888F0392	Officials in Liberty City announced yesterday that the river crossings between Algonquin and Alderney may reopen shortly. The Hickey Bridge and Booth Tunnel have been closed recently due to the terror alert the city has been living under intermittently the last few years. Is it me or is this just another example of the liberal pinkos who run that awful city bending over and letting terrorists give them one where the sun don't shine? Nothing gives our enemies strength like realizing that we are not on a 24-hour full-time alert and lockdown. If we don't cavity search every man, woman and child in that town right now, they deserve to die.

	E1AE35CF	Hell, I'm happy to help. I'll do some searches myself. To prove what a patriot I am, I let a stranger cavity search me every day. I'm not carrying any explosives or anthrax up my orifice and I'll prove it to you. How about you, Mayor Ochoa? It's high time you proved to all of us that you're not in league with our enemies and smuggling disaster up your ass.
