	97025CFB	Responding to bloggers who have demanded a timeline for withdrawal for the police occupation of our city bridges, Deputy Mayor Bryce Dawkins told PLO, "These terrorists want to take away our freedoms. And I do too. But look, we've done it first. We win. You lose. Eat my shit terrorists. Yeah, you like that? Do you? Daddy is in charge. That's the way a family works - a man and a woman and not two men," said Deputy Mayor Bryce Dawkins. Recycling has ceased in the city, causing angst and worry among many of the city's socially-conscious members, who know deep down in their righteous hearts that this is the apocalypse, the neocons have won, and we are fucked. Many officials are seriously worried that the stock market is set to crash.
