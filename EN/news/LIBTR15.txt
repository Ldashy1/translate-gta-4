	13A5DA82	Liberty City Mayor, Julio Ochoa, has caved to pressure and reopened the bridges separating Algonquin from the eastern boroughs. In a cautious move, the Hickey Bridge and Booth Tunnel have remained closed because N.O.O.S.E officials are convinced of specific but unnamed threats to the West River crossings. Some city officials have countered that not even a terrorist would want to live in Alderney.
