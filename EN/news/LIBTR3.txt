	93683E5D	A Full House Against Online Poker?
	8FFD94A9	Opponents of online gambling say that children as young as three know how to play poker online. Online poker fans say that they enjoy getting drunk and lying to strangers on the Internet, a pastime that is as old as America itself. But just as prohibition worked, this should work as well, say politicians.

	BDC7703C	Signaling that the war on vices has hit a red line pace, Congress made good on its pledge to outlaw online poker by moving the bill to the floor of the house. "Gambling is wrong. My religion says it's wrong, and I'm going to tell you how to spend your money and free time," said Congressman Shilton.

	16D3B98F	Can One Manny Make A Difference?
	1FCE5A07	Community Leader Manny Escuela was bored of seeing government initiatives fail to improve social conditions in South Bohan, so he has taken matters into his own hands. He is pushing for change and documenting these pushes in a film to be released later in the year. Although the exact nature of the changes is as yet unclear, Mr. Escuela is confident that the community can pull together under his leadership. He told reporters yesterday, "I just wanna make a difference any way I can." Escuela went on to say, "I been bad, and now I wanna make a difference and document that in a film, so people can see a tough guy can have a heart of gold - inspire people. I ain't doing this for the fame. I'm doing it because I love my community. And people from the community need to see me in a movie." Who needs sociologists when you've got committed citizens like Mr. Escuela?
