	D09E773B	Eris tries to sidestep the issue of sweatshops
	D412394E	In yet another attempt to deflect attention from their shocking labor practices in Africa and South-East Asia, Eris has released a pathetic message on its website from fat-cat founder Pete Vassal that discusses how products are sold "at a 10,000% markup" and how "children require less sleep and women are better at multi-tasking." No doubt all the right-wing, white-trash hillbillies who read Weazel News will lap up this capitalist propaganda. Eris is the embodiment of everything that is wrong with American greed and the relentless march towards globalization. You have all seen the photos of the children with their body parts glued together. Eris forces local communities into slave labor and then kills all the babies and women of child-bearing age when they become too expensive or organized.
	C6829E33	For too long, Pete Vasshole has been lining his pockets with the blood of desperate people in desolate places. Typical man. Vassal's latest PR stunt is nothing more than a slap in the face to oppressed, abused, persecuted and underprivileged people everywhere. We need make a stand against the Evil Eris Empire and all the gun-touting redneck xenophobes who follow it. As we lace up our shiny new pair of sneakers, it is all too easy to forget that a child on the other side of the globe is getting whipped in an underground dungeon. Be the bigger person. Boycott Eris.
