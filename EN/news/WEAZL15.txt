	9CE90944	In a bow to terrorists, Mayor Ochoa shows classic liberal weakness by reopening the bridges between the outer boroughs and Algonquin. Does he not know we are at war and all need to make some sacrifices if our way of life and freedoms are to be protected? Apparently not. Now he's made life easy for both commuters and those who would do us harm. It's classic liberal wooly thinking. What's needed is a good simple conservative principle: punish everyone - then you know you'll get the bad guys. The Hickey Bridge and the Booth Tunnel remain closed.

	AE00ECA7	Why? Because terrorists sell drugs to liberals to buy bombs to kill us all. It's really that simple. The police department said so yesterday and I for one believe them. Now that we finally have the truth, it isn't the military industrial complex that's the problem, so isn't it time that we punish drug addicts properly like the criminals they really are?
	9BC14828	We all know that liberals love drugs. From Vinewood cocaine parties to ecstasy-fueled swinging suburban romps, to pre-schoolers having their drinks laced with acid and college kids shooting up heroin, nothing says 'liberal drop out' like a family ruined by the ravages of drugs. Now, police are saying there is an incontrovertible link between drugs coming into our city and our nation and the terror threat we all face. It's the thing liberals love most - the fact that their licentious behavior is putting the lives of all of us at deadly risk.
