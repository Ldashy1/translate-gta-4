	6562A1D5	The link conservatives ignore at our peril

	A3EAAF3A	What does the news that the BAWSAQ 100 closed up 12 points mean to a man who can't buy a sandwich and has to degrade himself in public for money to buy cheap liquor? The stock market is nothing more than a big fat casino for rich people. Unfortunately, when they bust, we're all screwed. Conservatives think the future would be brighter if we invested all of our retirement money into oil and armaments. You should invest in sustainable crops, like marijuana. And recycle and wear hemp underwear. Please, if we don't, we'll totally die and I won't get to go to the smoldering dude festival in the desert and get cranked to the ether on peyote.

	1A58574E	So conservatives and police have been banging on about the link between drugs and terrorism - as if it is a surprise - but their equation does not quite add up. They left out one important variable: big business and, in particular, big oil. Drug money is laundered through the same patriarchal banking system as oil profits and big business. Drugs are BIG BUSINESS - supported by the same corrupt puppet governments that support both terror and the oil industry. The facts are clear - stop local communities from growing marijuana and they will gateway to opium and then very quickly to fundamentalism.

	2899F3D1	But no, the prohibitionists believe they can control everything and everyone, legislate morality and profit from all our misery, by fabricating a link between drug dealing in Colombia and terrorism in America. There is no link. Terrorism is a direct result of our foreign policy - a policy that is so inherently ludicrous it is beyond any parody I can imagine.
