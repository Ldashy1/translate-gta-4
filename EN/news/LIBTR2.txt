	B22F2AAD	Whatever the reason, this reporter is going to be driving home drunk, as he certainly can't afford a cab.
	B327B1F2	The Platypus had docked in many international ports on various continents before arriving in Liberty City. Its crew consisted of men from many countries including Taiwan, Egypt, and Europe. Captain Philippidis's remains are being returned to his wife in Thailand. The search for the rest of the Platypus's foreign, and possibly murderous, crew continues.
	A5A7119D	Liberals are complaining that our war mongering President has driven up the price of gas. Conservatives say immigrant cab drivers are greedy, un-American pro-union bullies and we should close the borders. The Taxi Drivers Association says the price increase is due to the increased risk of terrorism in Liberty City. We think it's because all the hipsters and neophytes have moved out of Algonquin and into Broker and drivers can't tell the difference between an unwashed trust fund kid who dresses like a street urchin and an actual hobo, so they cut their losses and overcharge everyone.
	AAFFA1A6	Another day, another body dragged from the Humboldt River. This time it is ship Captain, Zorba Philippidis - his body bloated and partially consumed by water rats. Autopsy results cite drowning as the cause of death but reveal massive quantities of alcohol in his system. Captain Philippidis recently arrived in East Hook Bay on his ship, the Platypus. All members of the crew of this ship remain unaccounted for since it was unloaded.

	D2AFA926	Some are concerned about the new measure, but the President set the country at ease, "Sleep tight America. Your government has everything under control," President Lawton said at the swearing-in ceremony, then issued a maniacal laugh that made pigeons fly startled from rooftops. Brown people are not the only problem. Eastern Europeans and Russians, once left to fight amongst themselves, are now coming to America and creating crime syndicates. Officials said that they are considering setting up a new task force to deal with the problem.

	C08984DA	Ushering in a whole new wave of pro-America feeling, 30,000 new N.O.O.S.E agents were sworn in to help defend the homeland. In what are promised to be intense interrogation techniques by federal agents, the extension of the Jingoism Act removes the checks and balances that were hindering protecting America. Another part of the provision includes throwing out all history books that might indicate abandoning a free republic to be a bad idea.

	151D7088	Before the War on Fun stormed the shores and alleyways of Liberty City, when Star Junction was equal parts grit, glamour and gutter, pills were popped, noses were white, and highball glasses shattered in passionate domestic violence altercations. It was a time when the only tip you left for a cab driver was a stain on his back seat and helpful suggestions regarding his mother. Now citizens are hostages in their own city - held handicap by taxi prices that have gone through the roof.

	A4DE155F	A Spokesman for the National Office of Security Enforcement in charge of customs and border protection is concerned. "This is a major security breach. One member of this vessel's crew is dead, the others are likely to be in our country without visas. Please, if you see anyone who looks remotely foreign, report them to the nearest police officer. These people are likely to be criminals, terrorists and sexual deviants - they're not from here."
