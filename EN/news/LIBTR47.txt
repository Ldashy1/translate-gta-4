	CA87AFDD	What kind of a nickname is that? Heads will roll for this. Oh, bad joke. I mean, people will suffer." Eddie Low was the killer's actual nickname. He was a loner from Dukes, who apparently kept an account of his actions online <a href="eddielowfilthslayer.blogsnobs.org">here</a> and on the popular networking site MyRoom.

	4D934A3F	Wolfe told us, "It's like the dotcom bubble in the 1990s - you feel high as a kite making money for doing nothing and throw around big words that mean nothing at business luncheons in the hope that nobody will see you are an empty shallow twit," Wolfe said. Wolfe, who has a PhD in economics, says that he has learnt his lesson and will stick to telling other people how to throw their life savings down the drain from now on.

Police believe he attacked the wrong person, and was himself killed in a fight. Detective Jon Atkinson told this newspaper, "It is very disappointing. I was just about to make an arrest. I'd solved the case. His name was Eddie Low. He lived in Dukes - I was literally heading over to his house when the news came in another body had turned up. Obviously, the screenplay I am writing about the case will now have a slightly different ending, in which I make the arrest, and it will carry the subtitle 'based on true events', because that will make a better story." The mayor commented, "This is not the LCPD's finest hour. We have a killer on the loose for months, and no leads; then they give him this stupid nickname - 'Eddie Low'.
	260DA178	The Internet is a terrifying place. Every click of the mouse leaves you wide open to online predators, sickening porn, identity theft or any number of other fraudulent schemes designed to bleed you dry and leave you penniless on the streets, turning tricks for scraps of food and swigs of ethanol. If you think that the Internet risk isn't real, it is time for you to think again. Darius Wolfe, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, has admitted that he was duped into paying $20,000 to a con artist. The 'Roman Empire Wealth System' pyramid scheme, located at <a href="www.money2makemoney.com">www.money2makemoney.com</a> promised millions of dollars to investors if they could sign up enough people below them and then move up to the Senator or Emperor levels.

	6AB51CC9	You may have heard the term "read my lips," but, according to academic studies, lip reading cognition has been dropping. Children aren't able to read lips at the levels they could 20 years ago, which is resulting in serious problems later in life. Trevor Hawkins, Lip Reading America President, noted, "Imagine if you mouth to a girl across the room 'I WANT TO EAT YOU' and she thinks you said 'I WANT TO BEAT YOU'? They are very different. That's why we started the Liberty City Lip Reading Bee." The Lip Reading Bee has replaced the Spelling Bee after the rise in computer-assisted spellchecking programs have made Americans unable to even write a sentence without computer assistance. The Bee ended in scandal yesterday as the C word was mouthed repeatedly at judges who were also called pedophiles by angry contestants.
