	BB42C7E3	Arch conservative and political gay basher, Bryce Dawkins, was yesterday hiding in rehab after he was discovered to have a double life. As well as a wife and children, Mr. Dawkins also had a boyfriend whom he kept in an apartment that the city financed. Photographs have emerged of Mr. Dawkins kissing Bernie Crane, his guest. Mr. Dawkins released a statement that read, "I am 100% heterosexual. Things look bad, but the evidence is just circumstantial. I do however have a substance abuse problem, which I am dealing with and I also have been addicted to bad behaviors, including visiting lap dancing clubs. I love women. Look at my wife. She's satisfied. Please leave my family alone. We need privacy. I (will) continue to stand up for what I believe in, even if I am just a man and a work in progress. I'm not gay and I never have been. Quite the opposite. I just have a soft spot for sad people who need looking after.

	AF4765C6	In what is no doubt an enormous embarrassment to relatives, police have announced that the recent death of Philipo Cantalato was due to an internal explosion. Part of the growing community of webcam users who gather to chat about beauty and fashion and bleach their stinky stovepipes online, Cantalato was attempting to singe the hairs near his Winking Walnut when an unplanned gas expulsion resulted in an explosion that raced up through Catalato's large intestine. "This fascination with the back door is not healthy," said Families Forever director, Mandy Shoren, "It distracts from what's important, and that's a good face to face vaginal pounding."

Rascalov was thought to be one of the principal players in the new wave of organized crime in Liberty City. Conspiracy theories abound as to how Mr. Rascalov met his end. The police believe it is a hit by another gangster, others claim that the hit was the work of a government assassin attempting to clean up the crime problem in Liberty City.
