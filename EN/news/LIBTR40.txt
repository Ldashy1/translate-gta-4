	CB7669FA	Kerry McIntosh was barely 12 steps out of rehab last night when she was arrested for DUI and possession of a controlled substance, believed to be a small amount of cocaine. Once the police were made aware of Kerry's celebrity status, she signed some autographs and was released with a warning. According to a statement issued by her agent, McIntosh has decided to sue the rehab center in Los Santos, claiming that she is just as messed up as when she arrived four days earlier. Lenny Tinderman, who runs the $60,000-a-night treatment center and is an active alcoholic himself, told reporters, "Miss McIntosh checked out two hours early, against all our advice. If she cannot complete the program, we cannot take responsibility for the repercussions." In a posting on the supermodel's blog, Kerry told fans that she is now on her way to a new rest facility in the Bahamas, "An enema and a game of tennis and I'll be back on track. If I'm going to face my demons, I want to do it with an ocean view."
	9EE63A6A	The serial killer who has been beheading joggers and other people foolish enough to go out late at night on their own has struck again. This time, it's the same old story. A young victim found in a sports bag. No head. And cops left rubbing theirs, as they wonder what to call him. Detective Jon Atkinson, who has been on the case since the beginning, made the following statement: "It's a great tragedy. People are focusing on the wrong things. Until the general public starts to focus on what matters, we don't have a chance of catching this guy. People are going to have to tell me: do they want the movie to be serious, or have a comic twist? Should I have a love interest? What about my partner? Will he be older and wiser, but close to retirement, a man who dies in the penultimate scene? Or a young punk, who needs a wisecracking older guy to show him the ropes? I'm really struggling with my first draft of this screenplay, and people are just going to have to be patient."
