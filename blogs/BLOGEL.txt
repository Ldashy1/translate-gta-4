	A5AAFC86	Eddie is happy today. And when I say happy, I mean empty and numb, like you are supposed to feel when the drugs kick in. I dressed up Boo Boo Wilkins like a baby and he licked gravy off my nipple. He's the luckiest cat in the whole wide world. What is that smell? Granny? Not on the mouth, PLEASE granny. How nice Eddie's hands are! Long, smooth fingers like a pianist. Eddie used to play the oboe until he lost it up the rectum of a park ranger. Back in the good old days before they all went away.
	A8010136	Eddie went out to play again earlier. Bad Eddie. Another zit on the back of society has been popped. He looked troubled, then startled, then quiet. His balls are in a glass next to my bed. My freezer is getting very full. Time for one of Eddie's famous casseroles. Boo Boo Wilkins loves Eddie's casseroles.
	C3AD4B93	Eddie has been a naughty boy. I only went for a walk by the river, mother, I promise. There's a jogger in the bushes. I HATE JOGGERS!! You are given the greatest gift of all - life - and what do you do with it? Jog. Fucking narcissists! LOOK AT ME. Look at me lunge and stretch. Look at me hopping in place while I wait for the lights to change. Oooooh, I'm not going to run, I'm not going to walk - I'm going to JOG. Get off the fucking fence before I impale you on it. Ooops, I already have. I brought the head back for Boo Boo Wilkins but he isn't impressed. That cat has got ideas too big for its britches. I like to cut the heads off joggers to see if they keep on running, like chickens. Sometimes the only difference between making love and making hate is a turn of the wrist. So tired...
	87FA92AE	The thought of you reading my weblog is quite a turn-on I can tell you. Trust me, it's not true. I make it all up, just like they make up where little boys and little girls come from. Lots of things turn me on - trepanation, armadillos, yeast infections - but I have to learn to control myself. Mother caught Eddie pumping devil paste out of his peanut one day and made me sleep in the dog kennel. I never liked that dog. The way it looked at me when I made it lick jam off my peanut. Those judging eyes. I made a finger puppet out of its esophagus. Nobody has contacted me on MyRoom yet. I just want to meet a nice girl. Or a boy. Where was Eddie tonight? Why am I in mother's nightgown?
	887379B9	Eddie made a joke. Eddie made a joke. Oh no, now Eddie made a poo poo.
	A10925B2	That Detective Atkinson is a moron. He'll never catch me. He can't even come up with a name for me. All he's interested in is getting his picture in the newspaper. I'm supposed to be the one getting the attention! Everybody thinks they can ignore Eddie. Well, maybe I am invisible. Maybe you can't see me. But another head is looking me straight in the eye right now. This is just the beginning, Atkinson. Complacency. Apathy. Indulgence. Is this what humanity has come to? Is this the civilization for which man was destined? If so, I don't want to be part of it. The gene pool is polluted. You do not deserve life. You make me want to puke. In fact, I'm going to.
	E3B68B6E	Eddie, you really must clean up that diarrhea!!!
	E7E690C1	That's all for now now. Time for Eddie to nurse on his prosthetic breast.
	F1EEB4CF	Nobody enters the house. EVER. Except for Boo Boo Wilkins, of course. Here kitty kitty. He killed a bird today and I ejaculated. Bad Eddie. I rubbed lemon juice on my peanut like Mother told me to. I stay in the house and I am alone; I go outside and all I see are imbeciles. Pointless morons treading water in a stagnant pool of mediocrity. Breeding, multiplying. Evolution has been halted and we are in regression. The human race is in decline. But Eddie gave natural selection another helping hand today. I left a present for you in a sports bag, Detective Atkinson! Another diseased soul vaccinated with a blow torch and a trowel. DO YOU SEE ME NOW??!! Fate is always around the corner, next door, a heartbeat away. Watching, whispering, waiting.
	CAC87930	That's better. I'll clean it up later. Will you Eddie, will you?
	D14ECEC3	Boo Boo Wilkins has ruined my day again. That cat is more devious than I ever imagined. I can see ridicule in its eyes - the animal actually believes that it is superior to me in some way. Must be terrible being a eunuch but that's what happens when you decide that the litter tray is optional. Eddie pooped in the litter tray once. It's not so bad.
	D3750FBB	Half a pound of basmati rice,
	340BD0EB	Half a pint of bourbon,
	3543A956	Still no friends on MyRoom. And I made a real effort to be approachable in my profile as well. People don't get Eddie and Eddie doesn't get people. Eddie had a girlfriend once. He kept her in the cellar. In fact, she must still be down there. Maybe it's because I'm an only child. Well, I am now, anyway. They found Eddie's brother in the pond. WHEN WILL THAT TAP STOP DRIPPING????????????????????????? Drip, drip, drip. I can feel the itch starting again; the itch that has to be scratched. I MUST GET STRONGER. You think Eddie's invisible, do you? You think you can just look at your feet and walk on by? Nobody listens to Eddie. But you will. You will hear my silence and feel my breath. Je suis un monstre.
	51958BFE	Pop! goes the abdomen.
	018BB456	That man in the pet shop is beautiful, in an unfathomable way.
	0947D4BA	Eddie went to take out some money from a bank today. Actually, from a banker. I cut it out of his pocket in the elevator. He had a nice face. I will go and wait for him tomorrow. I found some photos of Eddie in his little sailor's outfit earlier!!! Oh, how Eddie wanted to be a sailor!!! Then they locked me up in that camp for bad boys. Now it's just me alone in the world. And mother. Is that you, mother? No, it's just Eddie in mother's underwear. Bad Eddie. Such a bad little boy.
	188E19F0	Eddie's big Saturday night in: 1 bottle of sweet sherry. Check. Neighbor's puppy. Check. Floor sander. Check.
	6AB31658	Boo Boo Wilkins never made Eddie grow his hair long and wear a dress to school. Where is father now? Sleeping, Eddie, sleeping. I set up a MyRoom page yesterday but nobody has contacted me for anal sex yet. I saw a documentary about it on TV. I don't watch a lot of tv. Mother never allowed it. Just cartoons and wildlife programs.
	77E0A8A3	Oh, how it smells in here. You've got to clean the house. DO YOUR CHORES!!! Nasty, nasty Eddie.
	81822FB7	Eddie slept in the garden last night. Oh, what fun! What delightful fun! Under the apple tree. Then the birds starting chirping, drilling into my head with their messages of doom and subversion. I remember playing in that tree as a boy. Little Eddie with his little peanut. Look at Low! It's like a maggot! How I hated those showers. So many schools, so many showers, so many people to find. Remember me, Pennington? Remember me, Owens? Remember me, Dodson? Eddie is all grown up now and wants to show you what he knows about musculoskeletal manipulation. The itch is getting worse. What day is it? Tuesday? Friday? Is it fish today, mother? Must get out for a wander. Scratch that itch.
	573F72C7	Such a horrible way for mother to die. How could someone do such a thing? They tried to say that Eddie did it but I was too clever. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT CAT DOING NOW!!! Why would Eddie ever want to keep his mother's breasts in a shoebox under the bed, officer? I can wrap the police round my little finger. I have some vocal cords wrapped around my little finger right now. Not so chatty now, are you, my love? That silly girl at the hardware store. Smiling at Eddie when he bought the chicken wire. Smiling at Eddie when he bought the duct tape. All Eddie wanted to do was nurse on her but she had to play hard to get. Games. Always games. I've got a game for you. FIND YOUR EYES. How can it be 4pm? Time for bed. When did Eddie last sleep? It takes Eddie so long to go to bed. So many rituals...
	5C7BF9EA	It's time for me to speak to the world. To tell you who I am. To be famous, like I will be. I thought that the Internets were just for buying breast milk but I'm learning that they're so much more. All these millions of shadowy figures jostling for visibility. Are you alone in the dark waiting for Eddie? I'm finally starting to feel part of something; that I'm wired into a cosmos, a COMMUNITY. Eddie's never had any friends, except for Boo Boo Wilkins. I hate that cat. I hate that cat. I hate that cat. Always wailing and whining and wanting to be petted. I'll pet you, Boo Boo Wilkins - with a fucking cheese grater!!!!!! NO! Eddie would never hurt Boo Boo Wilkins.
	5EECA6AC	Mix it up and make it nice,
